            I've been happily developing on a Mac over the last 10+ years.
            However, I grew up on PC's and built a few rigs over the years for
            gaming and work. Now days a perk of working in Software our employer
            often supplies a well equipped box.

            I am actually pleasantly surprised how small this list is... These
            programs are at the core of everything I do daily. While we can
            write code in in VIM or a text editor, life is just better with the
            right tools.

                Is my editor of choice and I could not be happier! It 100% does
                everything I need it to and I am continuously impressed by the

                know exist. Tabs, split-view, fast and reliable.

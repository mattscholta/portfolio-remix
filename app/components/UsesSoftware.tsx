        I am actually pleasantly surprised how small this list is... These
        programs are at the core of everything I do daily. While we can write
        code in in VIM or a text editor, life is just better with the right
        tools.

            Is my editor of choice and I could not be happier! It 100% does
            everything I need it to and I am continuously impressed by the
            improvements I've seen to date.

            As far as terminal users go, I use it heavily every day. iTerm2 is
            free and full of features I use and many that I don't even know
            exist. Tabs, split-view, fast and reliable.

            At the core of the modern development workflow is 🐳 Docker. I can't
            begin to explain how enjoyable a great docker and docker-compose
            workflow can be.

            It's not that often that get to play designer but I do enjoy keeping
            up with the tools. Figma is available in the browser + app,
            incredibly fast, powerful, and FREE. I love it!

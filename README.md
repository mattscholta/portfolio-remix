# üèéÔ∏èüí® 2022 Portfolio

> Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web fundamentals to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.

This repo is rebuild and re-skin of my NextJS portfolio from 2021. Both are hosted on using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and really both are **incredible**.

- [2022 Portfolio](https://mattscholta.com) build with [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [2021 Portfolio](https://2021.mattscholta.com) build with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

**Technology:**

- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Setup

Currently the API calls are made to an external service, [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com). Now, until we can move to [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (or something a little more portable for "local development") you'll see failed API calls ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
